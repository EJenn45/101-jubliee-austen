        <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
        <div class="half-width">
          <p>I've made my home in Greensboro, North Carolina, after traveling to
             many parts of the world. My journey into tech started unconventionally
             with a degree in Textile Design and Marketing. As I became more
             passionate about my work in design, I was fasinated with the idea
             of bringing to life my ideas into the digital space. I wanted to
             merge my creativity with my technical skills to build meaningful and
             purposeful products.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="half-width">
          <p>That curiosity then led me into the technology industry in which
             I've been hooked ever since. When I learned how to build my first
             website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom and
             versatility that I was looking for in my work. Now, I've made a
             switch to front end development, where I can use my organization
             skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

            <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
            <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5
            by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy
            to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

            <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
            <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and
            build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load,
            and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best
            practices.</p>

            accurately convert it into a webpage that is a pixel-perfect match.</p>
